# TransSign
This project demonstrates a machine learning model that automates the detection and translation of text on English signboards into German. The workflow leverages EasyOCR for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to detect and extract text from images, uses the Hugging Face Transformers library for translation, displays the OCR results using OpenCV.
